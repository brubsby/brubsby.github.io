But breathing can be difficult for other reasons. Ash may be raining down from wildfires, smog might be a thick cloud around you. I cannot tell you to simply breathe to relax when the air you breathe may be poison. Breathing connects us to this earth, our source, good or bad. Breathe lightly when needed, deeply when able, and treasure the air, a force of life.
